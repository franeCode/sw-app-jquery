# Star Wars Character Generator
## About a project
This was the first jQuery project that I made during my Udemy course. 
This app allows users to view information about Star Wars characters. It retrieves data from a JSON file and displays character cards. When a card is clicked, detailed information about the character is shown. Users can navigate through the characters using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons, or view a random character. The app uses jQuery and AJAX for data retrieval and DOM manipulation.
